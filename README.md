## Activity 6

There are a number of differences between the original plain UI and this new styled UI. The most significant improvement in my oppinion is enhancements to the results table. The results table now has the header row shaded dark blue with white text with the column headers centered. Additionally, rows and columns are now separated by borders where as before there were no borders and the entries were separated with white space. These enhancements improve usability significantly when someone is looking through the results of a search.
